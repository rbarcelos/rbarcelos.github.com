## Additional Notes for the Springlab fork of this project

We forked the base version of RichMarker for two reasons:
 
1. To provide the code in the form of an ES6 module
2. Make the definition of the `RichMarker` and `RichMarkerPosition`
   objects lazy in order to simplify usage with tools like Webpack
   and Browserify
   
As such, please note that if you intend to use this module in an
environment without proper support for ES6 and ES6 modules you will 
need to transpile using a tool like [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/).
